## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

$ npm run start:prod
```

## Docker Deployment

To deploy this application using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/backend-project
   ```

3. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash

   ```

   This command will build the Docker image if it doesn't exist and start the containers in detached mode.

To stop the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
